Grid Maximum-Variance Experiment

Selected the point of maximum variance on the grid (G on paper) and recalculate variances.
Proceed until no improvement is made. This results in the surface maximum variance point being added to the trip.

Proceed adding points to the trip until the budget (T on paper) is exhausted.
